<!--
Partials are fragments of view code, which are called from views. Partials are
called with the render method. Rendering a partila is like copying and pasting
view code from another file. Our view is called _form.html.erb, while we render
the partial: 'form'.  This is a Rails convention for partial naming.
Partials are essentially the Rails view version of extract-method refactoring.
By consolidating reused code to one location.
